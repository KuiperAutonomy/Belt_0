This is the open-source Kuiper Autonomy repository. We build the backbone of our solutions here. In our commercialized version, we start by installing this library or cloning it, and then, adding customer-specific bits. We make sure that we maintain this library as a part of our open-source commitment while keeping our customers' privacy.
